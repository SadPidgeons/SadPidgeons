- 👋 Hi, I’m @SadPidgeons
- 👀 I’m interested in learning more about Azure, Python, and so much more.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AZ-900, and prepping for the class as soon as possible.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, I'm just new and want to help, rather than hurt.
- 📫 How to reach me; Twitter @SadPidgeons - Discord Zanzibarr#9235
